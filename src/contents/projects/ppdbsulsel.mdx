> ## Short Explanation

This project was made to facilitate over 100 thousand users from Sulawesi Selatan to register to their local high school. In this website we manage 2 different projects, the registration website and the dashboard to manage the registrants.

> ## Project Goals

This project objective is to give information about PPDB (Penerimaan Peserta Didik Baru) for local high school in Sulawesi Selatan. This website should facilitate registration, generating registration proof, and giving announcements about acceptance, it supports radius calculation from their house to the school location using geolocation API.

The dashboard on the other hand is used for the school admins to validate the registrants data, and manage the accepted students.
